# SpineZone CTA Usage Guidelines
## Appointment-Focused Call-to-Action Standards

**Purpose:** Ensure consistent, professional healthcare messaging across all website touchpoints  
**Updated:** August 2025  
**Status:** ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION

---

## üéØ PRIMARY CTA STRATEGY

### Core Principle
**All CTAs focus on APPOINTMENT BOOKING rather than consultations**  
*Rationale: Professional healthcare positioning, reduces "free" perception issues*

### CTA Hierarchy

#### 1. PRIMARY CTAs (Hero sections, main conversion points)
- **"Schedule Your Appointment"** ‚Üê *Most Important*
- **"Book Appointment Now"** ‚Üê *Urgency variant*

#### 2. SECONDARY CTAs (Supporting sections)
- **"Make an Appointment"**
- **"Reserve Your Appointment"**  

#### 3. SPECIFIC CTAs (Service/condition-specific)
- **"Schedule [Service] Appointment"** (e.g., "Schedule Back Pain Appointment")
- **"Book [Condition] Treatment"** (e.g., "Book Sciatica Treatment")

#### 4. ASSESSMENT CTAs (Evaluation contexts)
- **"Schedule Assessment Appointment"**
- **"Book Comprehensive Assessment"**

## üö´ FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE

### DO NOT USE:
- ‚ùå "Free consultation" 
- ‚ùå "Free assessment"
- ‚ùå "No obligation consultation"
- ‚ùå "Start free consultation" 
- ‚ùå "Get free consultation"
- ‚ùå "Book free consultation"

### WHY THESE ARE PROBLEMATIC:
1. **Diminishes Professional Value:** "Free" implies less value
2. **Healthcare Positioning:** Medical professionals schedule appointments, not consultations
3. **Insurance Compliance:** Appointments are covered services, consultations imply sales
4. **Trust Building:** Professional language builds credibility
