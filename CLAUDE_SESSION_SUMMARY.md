# Claude Code Session Summary - SpineZone Project

## Project Overview
Healthcare website (SpineZone) focused on physical therapy in San Diego with 90% success rate messaging.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Homepage Visibility Problem
- **Issue**: Components starting with `opacity-0`, appearing blank
- **Fix**: Modified HeroSection.tsx and globals.css to start visible
- **Files**: `src/components/HeroSection.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`

### 2. Booking Functionality Errors  
- **Issue**: Complex booking forms causing deployment errors
- **Solution**: Simplified to professional contact CTAs (phone/email)
- **Files**: `src/components/AppointmentBookingForms.tsx`, Professional contact components
